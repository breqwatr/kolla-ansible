# breqwatr/kolla-ansible

This is the BMCA image for Kolla-Ansible.

When pulling this container, you usually don't want the latest.
Instead, bBe sure to grab the image tagged with your release of OpenStack so it
matches the Kolla images. For instance, for Rocky you'd want to pull
`breqwatr/kolla-ansible:rocky`.
